# INFO 1121 Project

Throughout the semester-long group project for my INFO 1121 Designing Interactions course, my team embarked on a comprehensive design journey. We initiated the project by formulating a pivotal design question and identifying key stakeholders. Through meticulous user research, we gained a deep understanding of our stakeholders' identities and needs. This foundational insight fueled our brainstorming sessions where we envisioned innovative technological solutions. We then developed a series of prototypes, progressively refining our designs through rigorous evaluations. The culmination of our efforts is presented in a high-fidelity prototype, detailed in the video below.
